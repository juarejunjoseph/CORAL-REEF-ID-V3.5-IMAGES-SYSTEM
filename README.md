3.Provided Google drive link of the images that this will be the reference of the coral reefs the trained in the Teachable Machine or Tensorflow that will serve as ANN (Artificial Neural Network) that converted to a model then imported to the app that will use in offline mode. This is the heart of the app that functions the Image Recognition.
